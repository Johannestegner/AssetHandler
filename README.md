### Why?
This package is created for internal projects mainly. You are welcome to use it, contribute or just further develop it.  
The license used is the standard **MIT License** (check the provided LICENSE further down).  
  
The main reason I created this package is cause I needed a asset handler for my projects which followed my personal taste in how it was used.  
I tried a few different ones already existing and thought I could write my own quite fast. Hah... Yeah... Well, a few weeks and a bunch of hours later, here it is!  
Hopefully it will come in handy for others than me.  

### Docs
Documentation can be found in the Wiki.
